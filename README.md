[2024] A repository to save my small data science projects, specially data analysis of datasets from Kraggle. The projects are a way to practice what I'm currently learning in Data Science with online free courses.

# Structure:
- Project 1: My first notebook from Kaggle, using a dataset of universities salaries. I've applied what I was currently learning on data science, so I created some graphs with Seaborn and did some analisys with Pandas;
- Project 2: Simple application using streamlit, that shows some charts about the economic situation of each country of the world. In this project I learned the basics of streamlit and plotly;
- Project 3: An application using Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels and Ploty that analyses the correlation between biological measures and the amount of calories burnt during a workout, to create a machine learning model able to predict it.
